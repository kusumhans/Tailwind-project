After completing my core React concepts and building a React-based Weather App, I started learning Tailwind CSS.
This project is my first hands-on Tailwind CSS project, where I focused on creating a fully responsive card component.

The goal of this project was to understand Tailwind’s utility-first approach, responsive design principles, and modern UI structuring while keeping the code clean and reusable
